    <h2> Character List: </h2>
    <p>
      <strong> Lorelai Gilmore </strong>
      </p>
      <img id="lor" src="img/lor.jpg">  </img>
      <p> Super amazing mom. Got pregnant at 16 and left home in Hartford, Conneticut for Stars Hollow. Played by Lauren Graham and, in my personal opinion, the best character on the show (although she had questionable taste in men until the end of the show). </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Rory Gilmore </strong>
      </p>
      <img id='ror' src="img/rory.jpg"> </img>
      <p> Lorelai's daughter. Super into reading. Went to an Ivy League college (not gonna spoil it lol). Overall very kind but has pretty bad judgment. Played by Alexis Bledel. </p>
      <p>
        <strong> Luke Danes </strong>
      </p>
      <img id="luk" src="img/luke.jfif"> </img>
      <p> Owns "Luke's Diner". Had a huge crush on Lorelai, which totally drained me cause he always missed the best opportunities to tell her. Also one of my favorite characters because of how much he loved Rory and Lorelai. Played by Scott Patterson.</p>
      <p>
        <strong> Lane Kim </strong>
      </p>
      <img id = "lan" src= "img/lane.jpg"> </img>
      <p> Rory's best friend since infancy. Super strict and religious Korean mom. Plays the drums. Played by Keiko Agena. </p>
